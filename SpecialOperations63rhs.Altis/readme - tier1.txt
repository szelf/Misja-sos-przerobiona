====================================================

This multiplayer COOP mission will spawn enemies randomly around the map. It does so by choosing a random position on the map, called the patrol area.
Then the mission will randomly spawn different type of enemies around the patrol area.
The goal of this mission is to simulate a combat patrol in which you do not know the enemy force composition or where exactly they are located,
you only have a rough idea of where they are.
So in other words, the goal is to bring you a completely random mission each time you play.

Generally, the way you play this mission is that shortly after start, the patrol area marker is placed on the map, and you then know where to go.
Additional red markers may pop-up that give you a rough estimation where enemy positions could be.
You can spawn either air or ground vehicles for transport, and you then move out to the mission area to hunt down the enemies.
Once you think the area is clear, an admin can end the mission.



This mission is what Tier 1 Operations uses on their server. This mission has proven to be a lot of fun.
With a little bit of teamwork, it's even possible to do organized large scale engagements on a public server.
Or you can reduce the amount of enemies for smaller scale fighting.
I figured that there might be more people out there who might enjoy this mission, so here you go, have fun with it!



Please note that:
- Vehicles can be spawned at the red/white poles located at the barrier and 2 hangars close to where you spawn.
- The mission does not end automatically. An admin is required to decide when it's time to stop the mission.
- With 40 players, it's recommended to set the enemy amount to 200. With 20 players, to 100 enemies. This is assuming your server can handle such numbers.
- With less than 100 enemies, it's recommended to set inside the parameters that all enemy positions should be marked on the map (you'll get a rough indication).
