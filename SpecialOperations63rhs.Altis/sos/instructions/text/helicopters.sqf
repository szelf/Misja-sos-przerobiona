"Helicopters" hintC parseText "For pilots, we need to be able to coordinate with them to organize the transport runs of the other players. Therefore pilots <t color='#ff0000'>must have a microphone!</t><br/><br/>
<t color='#ff0000'>Helicopters are not for personal transport!</t><br/><br/>
Don't ask if you can spawn an <t color='#ff0000'>attack helicopter</t> to fly CAS. If it's needed, a fireteam leader will request it.<br/><br/>
Only experienced pilots when we do gaming sessions. If you want to train your pilot skills choose another time or server.<br/><br/>
We <t color='#ff0000'>kick</t> all the users who do not observe these basic rules.";
